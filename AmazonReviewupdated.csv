product arrived damaged and not working seller refuse to fix or replace and is blaming me for damage beware of purchasing from brown box seller
came in evening around 11pm so in thankful usps wa still working but had a few scratch on the outside a if it ha been used but im greatly in need of a good computer and so far it working terrific and fast the touch screen of course doesnt really have any use unless i am feeling lazy about using the mouse but this computer is great but please amazon or dell send a brand new computer without scratch on top of it because i would have put a 5 star if it came brand new buyer beware
this laptop wa ok for the price lack of usbc is a problem especially now that the power connector is broken not sure if it is the adapter or on the board in any case expected better from dell this is close to hp quality this is not a compliment
this is not the touch screen a advertised nothing about this item is a advertised could not even connect it the internet so not cool never again and i have been dealing with amazon for year and this is one of the worst experience i have encountered my son is crushed
laptop randomly shut itself off and would not restart worked fine otherwise when i finally had enough and contacted dell the warranty had expired in february 2019 i purchased in oct 2019 i wa promised a brand new laptop not someone used reject
so what do you give a sister who cook clean take out the trash and love facebook a new laptop i bought this laptop for the spec the laptop ha gobbs of memory and enough hard drive space for million of picture i hope she like it im pretty sure that she will love it
i bought this computer because i wa looking for a computer for my wife that had a ssd at least 16gb of ram and at least a i5 processor also my wife feel more comfortable working on window this one wa a good balance between price and spec it look a lot like a macbook pro but it feel a little more fragile than a mac she also liked that this one had a full keyboard including the number keypad the touchscreen in a thing like a laptop is something that i feel that is useless it doesnt respond a well a a modern cellphone doe we were looking for a laptop with ssd but this one also had an internal hdd of 1tb which is useful for storing all the data that are not critical to access that wa something nice that we found
so far after a few week of use we are loving this laptop i spent a lot of time researching to get a laptop within our budget that ran really well this one check off all the box speed memory sound and screen are all great very happy with our choice we use this for personal and business use
not sure at this time if the touch screen is worthy of the extra cost
only thing i dont like is even with turning on keyboard light which ha to be continually pressed difficult to see character on key
it cannot open the system to the desktop when it is first used and it warranty time is also wrong i bought the computer in january 2020 but the warranty list show that it warranty period can only reach november 2020 i i seriously suspect that this computer ha been used i tried to contact the seller and ask why but he didnt reply to me any information
i am a software developer and have been using some memory intensive program and needed an upgrade i have been extremely happy with this machine from the second it came out of the box boot speed is incredible with the ssd i timed my bootup from completely off is about 12 second i am running a data heavy node application heavy development server vscode spotify and about 10 tab on google chrome and this thing isnt even breaking a sweat with mentioned program im still using a little le than half the memory and barely utilizing the cpu i did a ton of research and this wa the absolute best bang for the buck i could find and would buy again in a heartbeat only flaw screen is okay i wasnt buying this machine for the screen but i have seen laptop in the price range with better display why is this thing touchscreen literally no need
i bought this laptop for personal home use mainly internet searching surfing and using microsoft office i do not have many hour on the machine yet i bought it configured with extra ram and a ssd for fast boot speedy and quiet operation overall the machine seems to boot quick and run fast my one negative is that this dell ha a very loud fan that cycle on and off with no optical drive i wonder what the chip set is doing to generate enough heat to make the fan run
update january 2021 we have had this laptop repaired twice and now it is officially useless very unhappy with the quality of the laptop failed during midterm project and final week do not buy we purchased this laptop for my collegebound engineering student price wa good and we like dell and have another inspiron with an ssd but not one that also ha a 1t hard drive we are surprised at how loud the fan is but would still recommend this laptop
it came poorly packed and not usable a the screen wa too dark even at the highest setting ten minute in an error message that the hard drive need to be scanned for error scan completed showed multiple system error asked for a replacement 9 day ago and return wa approved still being processed my daughter need a laptop for school and we have nothing after spending 70000
although the picture show black keyboard we received gray not a big deal to most but this wa for my parent who have a difficult time seeing the gray wa not a advertised
i have had this laptop for about a month and a half and i love it it boot up in second multitasking is super fast simultaneously downloading several file while listening to itunes and working on spreadsheet didnt slow this machine one bit and it ha load of memory space although i generally dont use the touchscreen feature it is kind of cool the fingerprint reader work perfectly you will be hard pressed to find a comparable laptop at anywhere close to this price i also bought the laplink pcmover software from amazon which made it a fast and seamless transfer
i wish it would weight le and the surface for the mouse would feel smother under my finger everything else is fine thank you
great laptop very fast and quiet not sure where people say the fan is too load because we cant hear anything the only reason i gave it a 4 star is because i wa on the phone with dell for two hour trying to resolve the hard drive issue the 1 tb wa not showing up on the laptop after several transfer from dell the right person wa able to activate the 1 tb drive everything else wa in working order
so far this look to be the best laptop that i have ever owned very fast using m2 solid state drive for o and 1 tb hdd for storage the description say no optical drive but mine came with a dvdrw drive did i receive the wrong model the only negative is no c port but that is just a small negative
run really fast and you can turn the back lit keyboard on or off with f10 nice screen plenty of port and dvd drive shuts down quick this one i have is silver instead of just black low heat with the computer nice sized screen very comfortable
i wa looking to replace a 7 year old laptop that seen better daysi looked for month on and off i add this one to my list because it matched the dimension of the old laptop with some upgrade and minus other stuff i dont need anymore just like everyone else i wa pleased with a new laptop i had an issue with with tag not matching what the software wa showing i called dell to see what the issue wa the agent informed me that the laptop wa upgrade by an authorized vendor they forgot to update the tag to show it been upgraded the agent then proceeded to tell me the upgrade bumped the cost of the unit from 3 00 to 400 higher than the base unit i went on dell website to price it out and he wa right i got way more than what i paid for it i have no complaint with the unit aside from the battery life
i have been scammed out of my money by dell the most dishonest and incompetent laptop pc manufacturer in the whole world after 3 week id bought it here on amazon it fan started to be so noisy that it could be heard all over my house and could not be stopped in any way by then one month had gone by and i could no longer return this lemon i called dell they took the pc changed the fan and surprise after just a few hour the truck noise from the fan returned even louder than before i wanna throw this bird out of the window i curse you dell people you are thief you have stolen my hardearned money and shame on amazon for not taking this lemon back i have been scammed out of my money may god annihilate dell and amazon
this computer ha proven to be fast and just what i needed setup wa easy and it move at lightening speed
not only is this hunk of junk not working i found out that the warranty run out in november 2020 just received on july 28 2020 would have been nice to put that in your product explanation
bought 2 of these for my grown up child they absolutely love this computer very happy
i can not use the laptop window need to be reloaded the seller did not return phone call and the return date expired in march purchased for tax return end of january feeling scammed
great little computer
laptop feel cheap key are super small and backlight make them very hard to see trackpad is horrible it flex and is hypersensitive to the point it almost unusable set up wa easy with the onboard dell ai assistant fan is a bit loud per other review and the machine doe run hot touchscreen is actually decent and work well speaker get buzzy even at medium volume played a few music video from yt due to the annoying trackpad and poor sound quality not sure if i will keep or return update system failure hardwarebios that prevents use must return to dell really bad never again dell
i wa so excited when i ordered my new dell ive bought 3 previous dell and absolutely loved them after doing due diligence on different model etc i settled on this one it wa a good price and i trusted dell literally from the time i plugged it in and pushed the start button nothing happened i waited about 15 minute thinking maybe it just needed to be plugged in awhile it did turn on but then it wa just a black screen i waited and waited i finally looked at the clock and after 4 minute 38 second i did get up and functioning but really i figured from the time i turned it on till it finally came on it probably about 8 minute this wa replacing my old dell latitude e5450 which i have owned for over 5 year i wanted a new fast computer this is not what i got it took forever for a site to load when i tried to close down a page id click on the x and wait and wait and wait let me say this i use my laptop for keeping touch with friendsfamily research recipe couponing sharing photo i do not download game stream video or download music i dont watch tv show i just wanted a fast computer i tried deleting all the bloat hardware but it didnt help i love the touch screen screen size battery life but this is running like crap im going to return it
literally the only thing i would say about this laptop is that i wish the touchscreen wa just a little more responsive dont get me wrong it still a great touchscreen i just wish it registered the touch just a little more accurately other than that the laptop is super fast and i havent had any issue i wa a little hesitant to by a dell because i thought gaming brand like asus might be better constructed but going forward i will definitely consider dell this ha been the best laptop ive owned so far
im very happy with the performance
my purchase of this laptop ha proven to be everything i had hoped for ive had no problem since it arrived and setup wa snap i had some good technical advice from my son in the selection and he came through
excellent item
product is used pacifically for personbusiness use only
it work great right out of the box adding microsoft office professional fast quiet and responds fast
so for so good still setting it up
it doe a advertised quick connectivity via wifi
dell product are top of the heep
meh
the laptop arrived on time and exactly a advertised i plan on using it for writing research and coding
i usually wait awhile before writing review on computer equipment but in 10months no issue and performs a expected
ad offered a new machine machine delivered is used warranty expires on dec 24 two day from now
good computer for a good price
laptop is amazing it fast and display is good we can definitely recommend to student and for office purpose
i wish i didnt waste money buying the budget acerasus model first this is my 3rd laptop in a many month and finally an excellent one
i wa going to return this at first because i thought i just had to have a brand new computer and didnt notice it wa a used laptop i had contacted the seller and everything about returning it they said i could no problem but when i got it i decided to check it out i am glad i did i got everything i wanted in a very good laptop for le than i would have spent for a brand new one it wa in brand new condition too no scratch or anything my wireless mouse didnt work in one of the port but doe work in the others on the opposite site which actually worked out better the touchscreen come in handy too at time recorded sound quality is good the recording video quality could have been a bit better but all in all i am very pleased with this laptop
the bootup is quite fast exceeds my last laptop hand down i dont use the touch screen at all so i didnt rate it really seems like overkill on this machine i would have given it a 5 star rating except it doe not have a usb c connection i wa going to hook it up to a docking station but didnt realize that it did not have that capability i guess i should have looked closer other user have complained about fan noise i do not have any issue with the fan only occasionally can i even hear it i have been a dell user for many year now and i have also had several other brand of laptop but dell is my preferred laptop
speed is ok screen is lower end quality bad contrast washed out i received a used unit not new a listed laptop work correctly after some update were applied perhaps a like new should have been in the description
nnnnnnnnnn n n muy buen equipo pero el que recibí aparentemente tiene problema con la memoria ram pues al instalar un programa nuevo o exigirle al equipo el window se tranca y sale una pantalla azul de error luego del reinicio se autoresuelve pero resulta algo incómodo que te suceda frecuentementen n n n
when i tried to start the computer the first time it said no bootable item i go to dellcomsupport and find out the warranty expired 26 jun 2019 i ordered the computer in january on 2020 avoid this product and seller at all cost total rip off
not very happy with the screen high density look the new window and office have been hard to implement i have tried to adjust the setting but still cannot get the system to perform a needed
absolutely love it
good day i live in argentina i bought the product from you in february a friend brought it to me in march from miami and it broke a month in april i bought it from argentina at first it worked well but one day the hard drive failed and the window blue screen went on it never worked again how can we solve this problem because i consider that they sold me a failed product i am looking forward to your response
it light enough and wa slightly overheating on first use but the speed is great and ssd fly right now i cant fault the pc save that i belong to that camp that doesnt understand the need of a touch screen laptop i think it a waste nonetheless dell delivered a expected
this computer ha an amazing processor it is so fast and yet had a reasonable price im very happy with it
i ordered new and recurved used one i will return it
i purchased this laptop with upgraded ram 32gb and ssd 1tb it arrived near may 15 2019 the fan died this morning june 26 2020 only one year and 6 week from when i purchased the laptop the warranty is for 3yr and 1yr when i ran diagnostics it said the warranty started in 2018 and ended december of 2019 dell wanted to charge me for support when i asked to escalate chat to a supervisor they said no one wa working until the weekday i have been buying dell laptop for 20 year for work and never ha anything broken within the first year in fact i usually buy the cheapest one and change them every 2 year this is the first time i purchased a more expensive one thinking it would last at least a long a the 500 laptop nor have i ever had a support person blow me off like this
the boot time is pretty long after 30 min of moderate usage i started getting not responding error load time for application wa surprisingly long the typing on the keyboard wa laggy just out of the box i would not recommend this laptop for any more than light surfing and streaming the seller is awesome though i would buy from them any time
i did not like it because it din not work right also when will i receive my refund it been one month
my son ha the same device snd i liked it but the silver keyboard wa hard for me to see so wanted a silver case with black keyboard the contrast of white letterson black would be easier for me to see picture showed that nothing in description about keyboard except it wa backlit opened box and no black keyboard very disappointed
excellent pc work perfectly is very fast it wa worth the money
best laptop i have ever had and i have had 4 others
ive used this laptop for a few week now and can say it met what i needed it for so far
i love it
the item came promptly from the beginning the touch screen didnt work but i could live with that but when i went to take a class and couldnt hear a message popped up that there wa no sound card now they wont issue a refund and are saying it amazon responsibility getting the royal run around
overall good laptop for casual use i am not a fan of the backlit keyboard because it can be difficult to see the key sometimes i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a fast easy to use solution for shopping reading and reasearch
this laptop have been giving my son significant issue especially with the battery mere week after purchasing the laptop it will not work unless it is plugged in my son ha his school assignment and is having nightmare trying to complete an assignment he tried to persist with it but working with a laptop that doe not give you a good half hour after powering up something is wrong some letter on the keyboard stick when you press them and do type a a parent and the one that purchase this laptop i know that i have disadvantage my son and feel very responsible for this inadequate purchase on my part
i bought this model at 800 realizing it isnt on the high or low end of the spectrum when it come to buying a laptop but ive already sent this unit in twice for repair and it look like im going to have to send it again im not saying anything negative about the customer service which is why im giving 2 star because theyve been nothing but kind and have assisted me greatly but to send in a unit three time for repair within three month and cost 800 save your money and look for a different unit
fast and perfect computer
it ha already had issue that require repair beyond the inhouse it guy
this worked a expected and is a really good value for a laptop that ha a 2nd hd
all good with the laptop ecxept for the ethernet speed the specification said gigabit ethernet port but it max up at 100mbps download i spoke to dell support tech and i tried everything to get it over 100mbps but no luck i wa able to get the wifi speed over 200mbps but still low based on my 600mbps internet service
nnnnnnnnnn n n me sorprendio la rapidez y la practicidad esta e mi primera laptop con pantalla tactil me llevo un tiempo acostumbrarme de dejar de usar el mouse muy liviana puedo llevarlo tanto al cafe al parque o a la cama la betería con excelente vida útil para mi a sido una buena compran n n n
love my laptop it sleek efficient light and easy to use
product sold a used but the announcement said a new when i received the product i tried to find out how long i would have to guarantee unfortunately i wa informed by the service code that the guarantee had already expired
this laptop is used by my wife and replaces her older 2016 dell inspiron 15 3000 3552 laptop she enjoys the speed feel of the keyboard and the touchscreen display havent heard of any complaint only praise
this review is being written by a non techie person good memory well lit screen easy use i use this laptop for email and publisher work well the laptop is heavier then you might like if you carry your laptop often it is fine for me a i rarely take it off my desk at home i thought the price wa very good for the capability it ha
best money i have ever spentlove the backlight keyboardworks great and very fasti would really recommend this product
after about 25 month of using this laptop i started to get the blue screen of death error message contacted the seller and got no response it turned out that the the thirdparty extra memory that wa added to the original dell laptop wa defective i ended up spending more money to fix this through dell because it wa not covered by manufacture warranty this issue seam to be a very common with this retailer so dont buy unless you are willing to spend extra money on a brand new laptop
great product
it great
i got this a a gift from my best friend she went all out loading it with ram and a sata drive i cannot believe how fast it is a soon a i hit the last digit for my password when signing in boom it load it s backlit which is a god send it o super slim and lightweight all of my laptop have had trouble waiting for cache in chrome no more nothing ever get hung up i never wait for a page to load the touch pad wa odd so i went in and reset the whole thing and i never have a problem with it anymore i went in to taskmanager and turned off thing running in the background and did the same in setting open setting click on privacy click on background apps under the choose which apps can run in the background section turn off the toggle switch for the apps you want to restrict so these made it faster also i use this thing sometmes 12 hour a day and it ha been a joy i am so happy the seller made this build possible
warning avoid all dell product in the event that you might need to call customer support i have an inspiron 15 gaming 7567 and wa out of warranty when i experienced a major slow down in performance and slow wifi through just the laptop 20 mbps download while other device were recieving 600 mbps hoping to speak with tech support i purchased a single incident support for advanced software support for 99 after submitting payment i wa never contacted by tech support instead it say it would take 2 day to process eventhough prior to paying for the service they said to stay by your phone for tech to contact you right away regarding your issue i eventually solved the problem by spending 7 hour refreshingrebooting window 10 since dell tech did not help i assumed i could easily get a refund for the single incident support for advanced software support this is where it got ugly i called support line and got bounced around from deptment to deptartment having to reexplain my refund request each time after 30 min i thought i finally reached the right department the representative said they needed to put me on a short hold i wa promptley hung up on after calling back it took over 2 hour for them to process a refund all the while repeating my first experience between department after 1 12 hour into the call i thought i wa seriously being punked exaserbating this horrible experience wa a definiite communication breakdown support agent that i spoke with are difficult to understand dell tech support is completely overseas and it is not possible to speak to someone were english language is their first language awful awful awful experience avoid buyer beware your device will need support at some time you were forewarned
the screen quality is very good especially for gaming and movie keypad and mouse ha a good feel it typing noise is a little noticeable even if to type softly the 156inch size is very good for multiwindow working which is good for work or class notetaking the only thing that doe make me regret buying this laptop is the noise that the fan make when it overheats if you are doing anything big on the laptop it will come to overheating quicker thus will trigger the epic fan noise this can be a distraction in a quite environment such a library or classroom a well battery life will go down quickly if you do big thing such a gaming or streaming a movie with a cable charger it all good it okaygoodish laptop
the only thing i didnt like there wa one screw that wa not screwed in completely
used for my daughter to go to college work great
overall this laptop is ok i dont love it the builtin wifi antenna is submediocre i had to buy an external netgear a6210 adapter it wa dirt slow watching video otherwise no it wasnt my router the other device were fine using the wifi in my house also the trackpad is squishy the trackpad just feel poorly made like an old car that is about to fall apart otherwise it performs fine
i ordered this laptop in december 2019 for my daughter 18th birthday after 1 week it stopped working to this date 02172020 i have been back and forth with the seller to send me their information to ship back the item and to get a full refund dont waste your money
bought mine from costco thankfully so it wa super easy to return the fan is louder than an airplane seriously it so loud it giving me a headache which i might overlook if i didnt spend all my time on this computer waiting for something to happen soooo sloooowwww i have 10year old computer for my kid that run program and load page faster than this piece of junk brand new pretty much giving up on dell at this point
the dc adapter plugin is not a tight fit and easily becomes loose and let your battery run down while working i understand it a dell thing had to buy and install a new one also the hhd hard drive crashed after a year while under warranty so i sent it back to dell for a new one fearing it wa a refurbished hard drive i bought a 1tb crucial ssd and installed it happy with it now
this is my second dell laptop the first one wa great and only replaced to get window 10 this one ha been a problem from the beginning always message popping up if i press too hard on the key then there are pop ups that prevent me from typing now after le than a year the key seem to stick and it slows me down trying to get a computer fixed because i use it for bill etc is difficult so i just put up with it but my next laptop probably wont be a dell
dell ha some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life my hard drive failed after le than a year of use and after going through 4 level of support they told me there is nothing they can do except to pay for a repairxa0dell hard drive should last more than a year and if they dont you should stand behind your product very disappointing and it will be the last dell i ever buy for our family which mean something a i will likely be purchasing 4 laptop in the next 5 year a my child get older
very disappointing to have so short battery life which go down withing 1h bad product
beautiful and fast
very satisfied with this purchase
