Review,sentiment
product arrived damaged and not working seller refuse to fix or replace and is blaming me for damage beware of purchasing from brown box seller,negative
came in evening around 11pm so in thankful usps wa still working but had a few scratch on the outside a if it ha been used but im greatly in need of a good computer and so far it working terrific and fast the touch screen of course doesnt really have any use unless i am feeling lazy about using the mouse but this computer is great but please amazon or dell send a brand new computer without scratch on top of it because i would have put a 5 star if it came brand new buyer beware,positive
this laptop wa ok for the price lack of usbc is a problem especially now that the power connector is broken not sure if it is the adapter or on the board in any case expected better from dell this is close to hp quality this is not a compliment,negative
this is not the touch screen a advertised nothing about this item is a advertised could not even connect it the internet so not cool never again and i have been dealing with amazon for year and this is one of the worst experience i have encountered my son is crushed,negative
laptop randomly shut itself off and would not restart worked fine otherwise when i finally had enough and contacted dell the warranty had expired in february 2019 i purchased in oct 2019 i wa promised a brand new laptop not someone used reject,negative
so what do you give a sister who cook clean take out the trash and love facebook a new laptop i bought this laptop for the spec the laptop ha gobbs of memory and enough hard drive space for million of picture i hope she like it im pretty sure that she will love it,positive
i bought this computer because i wa looking for a computer for my wife that had a ssd at least 16gb of ram and at least a i5 processor also my wife feel more comfortable working on window this one wa a good balance between price and spec it look a lot like a macbook pro but it feel a little more fragile than a mac she also liked that this one had a full keyboard including the number keypad the touchscreen in a thing like a laptop is something that i feel that is useless it doesnt respond a well a a modern cellphone doe we were looking for a laptop with ssd but this one also had an internal hdd of 1tb which is useful for storing all the data that are not critical to access that wa something nice that we found,positive
so far after a few week of use we are loving this laptop i spent a lot of time researching to get a laptop within our budget that ran really well this one check off all the box speed memory sound and screen are all great very happy with our choice we use this for personal and business use,positive
not sure at this time if the touch screen is worthy of the extra cost,neutral
only thing i dont like is even with turning on keyboard light which ha to be continually pressed difficult to see character on key,positive
it cannot open the system to the desktop when it is first used and it warranty time is also wrong i bought the computer in january 2020 but the warranty list show that it warranty period can only reach november 2020 i i seriously suspect that this computer ha been used i tried to contact the seller and ask why but he didnt reply to me any information,negative
i am a software developer and have been using some memory intensive program and needed an upgrade i have been extremely happy with this machine from the second it came out of the box boot speed is incredible with the ssd i timed my bootup from completely off is about 12 second i am running a data heavy node application heavy development server vscode spotify and about 10 tab on google chrome and this thing isnt even breaking a sweat with mentioned program im still using a little le than half the memory and barely utilizing the cpu i did a ton of research and this wa the absolute best bang for the buck i could find and would buy again in a heartbeat only flaw screen is okay i wasnt buying this machine for the screen but i have seen laptop in the price range with better display why is this thing touchscreen literally no need,positive
i bought this laptop for personal home use mainly internet searching surfing and using microsoft office i do not have many hour on the machine yet i bought it configured with extra ram and a ssd for fast boot speedy and quiet operation overall the machine seems to boot quick and run fast my one negative is that this dell ha a very loud fan that cycle on and off with no optical drive i wonder what the chip set is doing to generate enough heat to make the fan run,positive
update january 2021 we have had this laptop repaired twice and now it is officially useless very unhappy with the quality of the laptop failed during midterm project and final week do not buy we purchased this laptop for my collegebound engineering student price wa good and we like dell and have another inspiron with an ssd but not one that also ha a 1t hard drive we are surprised at how loud the fan is but would still recommend this laptop,negative
it came poorly packed and not usable a the screen wa too dark even at the highest setting ten minute in an error message that the hard drive need to be scanned for error scan completed showed multiple system error asked for a replacement 9 day ago and return wa approved still being processed my daughter need a laptop for school and we have nothing after spending 70000,negative
although the picture show black keyboard we received gray not a big deal to most but this wa for my parent who have a difficult time seeing the gray wa not a advertised,negative
i have had this laptop for about a month and a half and i love it it boot up in second multitasking is super fast simultaneously downloading several file while listening to itunes and working on spreadsheet didnt slow this machine one bit and it ha load of memory space although i generally dont use the touchscreen feature it is kind of cool the fingerprint reader work perfectly you will be hard pressed to find a comparable laptop at anywhere close to this price i also bought the laplink pcmover software from amazon which made it a fast and seamless transfer,positive
i wish it would weight le and the surface for the mouse would feel smother under my finger everything else is fine thank you,positive
great laptop very fast and quiet not sure where people say the fan is too load because we cant hear anything the only reason i gave it a 4 star is because i wa on the phone with dell for two hour trying to resolve the hard drive issue the 1 tb wa not showing up on the laptop after several transfer from dell the right person wa able to activate the 1 tb drive everything else wa in working order,positive
so far this look to be the best laptop that i have ever owned very fast using m2 solid state drive for o and 1 tb hdd for storage the description say no optical drive but mine came with a dvdrw drive did i receive the wrong model the only negative is no c port but that is just a small negative,positive
run really fast and you can turn the back lit keyboard on or off with f10 nice screen plenty of port and dvd drive shuts down quick this one i have is silver instead of just black low heat with the computer nice sized screen very comfortable,positive
i wa looking to replace a 7 year old laptop that seen better daysi looked for month on and off i add this one to my list because it matched the dimension of the old laptop with some upgrade and minus other stuff i dont need anymore just like everyone else i wa pleased with a new laptop i had an issue with with tag not matching what the software wa showing i called dell to see what the issue wa the agent informed me that the laptop wa upgrade by an authorized vendor they forgot to update the tag to show it been upgraded the agent then proceeded to tell me the upgrade bumped the cost of the unit from 3 00 to 400 higher than the base unit i went on dell website to price it out and he wa right i got way more than what i paid for it i have no complaint with the unit aside from the battery life,positive
i have been scammed out of my money by dell the most dishonest and incompetent laptop pc manufacturer in the whole world after 3 week id bought it here on amazon it fan started to be so noisy that it could be heard all over my house and could not be stopped in any way by then one month had gone by and i could no longer return this lemon i called dell they took the pc changed the fan and surprise after just a few hour the truck noise from the fan returned even louder than before i wanna throw this bird out of the window i curse you dell people you are thief you have stolen my hardearned money and shame on amazon for not taking this lemon back i have been scammed out of my money may god annihilate dell and amazon,negative
this computer ha proven to be fast and just what i needed setup wa easy and it move at lightening speed,positive
not only is this hunk of junk not working i found out that the warranty run out in november 2020 just received on july 28 2020 would have been nice to put that in your product explanation,negative

laptop feel cheap key are super small and backlight make them very hard to see trackpad is horrible it flex and is hypersensitive to the point it almost unusable set up wa easy with the onboard dell ai assistant fan is a bit loud per other review and the machine doe run hot touchscreen is actually decent and work well speaker get buzzy even at medium volume played a few music video from yt due to the annoying trackpad and poor sound quality not sure if i will keep or return update system failure hardwarebios that prevents use must return to dell really bad never again dell,negative
i wa so excited when i ordered my new dell ive bought 3 previous dell and absolutely loved them after doing due diligence on different model etc i settled on this one it wa a good price and i trusted dell literally from the time i plugged it in and pushed the start button nothing happened i waited about 15 minute thinking maybe it just needed to be plugged in awhile it did turn on but then it wa just a black screen i waited and waited i finally looked at the clock and after 4 minute 38 second i did get up and functioning but really i figured from the time i turned it on till it finally came on it probably about 8 minute this wa replacing my old dell latitude e5450 which i have owned for over 5 year i wanted a new fast computer this is not what i got it took forever for a site to load when i tried to close down a page id click on the x and wait and wait and wait let me say this i use my laptop for keeping touch with friendsfamily research recipe couponing sharing photo i do not download game stream video or download music i dont watch tv show i just wanted a fast computer i tried deleting all the bloat hardware but it didnt help i love the touch screen screen size battery life but this is running like crap im going to return it,negative
literally the only thing i would say about this laptop is that i wish the touchscreen wa just a little more responsive dont get me wrong it still a great touchscreen i just wish it registered the touch just a little more accurately other than that the laptop is super fast and i havent had any issue i wa a little hesitant to by a dell because i thought gaming brand like asus might be better constructed but going forward i will definitely consider dell this ha been the best laptop ive owned so far,positive
im very happy with the performance,positive
my purchase of this laptop ha proven to be everything i had hoped for ive had no problem since it arrived and setup wa snap i had some good technical advice from my son in the selection and he came through,positive
