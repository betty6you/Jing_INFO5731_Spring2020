product arrived damaged and not working seller refuse to fix or replace and is blaming me for damage beware of purchasing from brown box seller
this laptop wa ok for the price lack of usbc is a problem especially now that the power connector is broken not sure if it is the adapter or on the board in any case expected better from dell this is close to hp quality this is not a compliment
this is not the touch screen a advertised nothing about this item is a advertised could not even connect it the internet so not cool never again and i have been dealing with amazon for year and this is one of the worst experience i have encountered my son is crushed
laptop randomly shut itself off and would not restart worked fine otherwise when i finally had enough and contacted dell the warranty had expired in february 2019 i purchased in oct 2019 i wa promised a brand new laptop not someone used reject
it cannot open the system to the desktop when it is first used and it warranty time is also wrong i bought the computer in january 2020 but the warranty list show that it warranty period can only reach november 2020 i i seriously suspect that this computer ha been used i tried to contact the seller and ask why but he didnt reply to me any information
update january 2021 we have had this laptop repaired twice and now it is officially useless very unhappy with the quality of the laptop failed during midterm project and final week do not buy we purchased this laptop for my collegebound engineering student price wa good and we like dell and have another inspiron with an ssd but not one that also ha a 1t hard drive we are surprised at how loud the fan is but would still recommend this laptop

i wa so excited when i ordered my new dell ive bought 3 previous dell and absolutely loved them after doing due diligence on different model etc i settled on this one it wa a good price and i trusted dell literally from the time i plugged it in and pushed the start button nothing happened i waited about 15 minute thinking maybe it just needed to be plugged in awhile it did turn on but then it wa just a black screen i waited and waited i finally looked at the clock and after 4 minute 38 second i did get up and functioning but really i figured from the time i turned it on till it finally came on it probably about 8 minute this wa replacing my old dell latitude e5450 which i have owned for over 5 year i wanted a new fast computer this is not what i got it took forever for a site to load when i tried to close down a page id click on the x and wait and wait and wait let me say this i use my laptop for keeping touch with friendsfamily research recipe couponing sharing photo i do not download game stream video or download music i dont watch tv show i just wanted a fast computer i tried deleting all the bloat hardware but it didnt help i love the touch screen screen size battery life but this is running like crap im going to return it

speed is ok screen is lower end quality bad contrast washed out i received a used unit not new a listed laptop work correctly after some update were applied perhaps a like new should have been in the description
when i tried to start the computer the first time it said no bootable item i go to dellcomsupport and find out the warranty expired 26 jun 2019 i ordered the computer in january on 2020 avoid this product and seller at all cost total rip off
not very happy with the screen high density look the new window and office have been hard to implement i have tried to adjust the setting but still cannot get the system to perform a needed

i purchased this laptop with upgraded ram 32gb and ssd 1tb it arrived near may 15 2019 the fan died this morning june 26 2020 only one year and 6 week from when i purchased the laptop the warranty is for 3yr and 1yr when i ran diagnostics it said the warranty started in 2018 and ended december of 2019 dell wanted to charge me for support when i asked to escalate chat to a supervisor they said no one wa working until the weekday i have been buying dell laptop for 20 year for work and never ha anything broken within the first year in fact i usually buy the cheapest one and change them every 2 year this is the first time i purchased a more expensive one thinking it would last at least a long a the 500 laptop nor have i ever had a support person blow me off like this
the boot time is pretty long after 30 min of moderate usage i started getting not responding error load time for application wa surprisingly long the typing on the keyboard wa laggy just out of the box i would not recommend this laptop for any more than light surfing and streaming the seller is awesome though i would buy from them any time
i did not like it because it din not work right also when will i receive my refund it been one month
the item came promptly from the beginning the touch screen didnt work but i could live with that but when i went to take a class and couldnt hear a message popped up that there wa no sound card now they wont issue a refund and are saying it amazon responsibility getting the royal run around
this laptop have been giving my son significant issue especially with the battery mere week after purchasing the laptop it will not work unless it is plugged in my son ha his school assignment and is having nightmare trying to complete an assignment he tried to persist with it but working with a laptop that doe not give you a good half hour after powering up something is wrong some letter on the keyboard stick when you press them and do type a a parent and the one that purchase this laptop i know that i have disadvantage my son and feel very responsible for this inadequate purchase on my part
i bought this model at 800 realizing it isnt on the high or low end of the spectrum when it come to buying a laptop but ive already sent this unit in twice for repair and it look like im going to have to send it again im not saying anything negative about the customer service which is why im giving 2 star because theyve been nothing but kind and have assisted me greatly but to send in a unit three time for repair within three month and cost 800 save your money and look for a different unit
it ha already had issue that require repair beyond the inhouse it guy
product sold a used but the announcement said a new when i received the product i tried to find out how long i would have to guarantee unfortunately i wa informed by the service code that the guarantee had already expired
after about 25 month of using this laptop i started to get the blue screen of death error message contacted the seller and got no response it turned out that the the thirdparty extra memory that wa added to the original dell laptop wa defective i ended up spending more money to fix this through dell because it wa not covered by manufacture warranty this issue seam to be a very common with this retailer so dont buy unless you are willing to spend extra money on a brand new laptop
warning avoid all dell product in the event that you might need to call customer support i have an inspiron 15 gaming 7567 and wa out of warranty when i experienced a major slow down in performance and slow wifi through just the laptop 20 mbps download while other device were recieving 600 mbps hoping to speak with tech support i purchased a single incident support for advanced software support for 99 after submitting payment i wa never contacted by tech support instead it say it would take 2 day to process eventhough prior to paying for the service they said to stay by your phone for tech to contact you right away regarding your issue i eventually solved the problem by spending 7 hour refreshingrebooting window 10 since dell tech did not help i assumed i could easily get a refund for the single incident support for advanced software support this is where it got ugly i called support line and got bounced around from deptment to deptartment having to reexplain my refund request each time after 30 min i thought i finally reached the right department the representative said they needed to put me on a short hold i wa promptley hung up on after calling back it took over 2 hour for them to process a refund all the while repeating my first experience between department after 1 12 hour into the call i thought i wa seriously being punked exaserbating this horrible experience wa a definiite communication breakdown support agent that i spoke with are difficult to understand dell tech support is completely overseas and it is not possible to speak to someone were english language is their first language awful awful awful experience avoid buyer beware your device will need support at some time you were forewarned
i ordered this laptop in december 2019 for my daughter 18th birthday after 1 week it stopped working to this date 02172020 i have been back and forth with the seller to send me their information to ship back the item and to get a full refund dont waste your money
bought mine from costco thankfully so it wa super easy to return the fan is louder than an airplane seriously it so loud it giving me a headache which i might overlook if i didnt spend all my time on this computer waiting for something to happen soooo sloooowwww i have 10year old computer for my kid that run program and load page faster than this piece of junk brand new pretty much giving up on dell at this point
this is my second dell laptop the first one wa great and only replaced to get window 10 this one ha been a problem from the beginning always message popping up if i press too hard on the key then there are pop ups that prevent me from typing now after le than a year the key seem to stick and it slows me down trying to get a computer fixed because i use it for bill etc is difficult so i just put up with it but my next laptop probably wont be a dell
dell ha some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life my hard drive failed after le than a year of use and after going through 4 level of support they told me there is nothing they can do except to pay for a repairxa0dell hard drive should last more than a year and if they dont you should stand behind your product very disappointing and it will be the last dell i ever buy for our family which mean something a i will likely be purchasing 4 laptop in the next 5 year a my child get older
very disappointing to have so short battery life which go down withing 1h bad product
title description is different from actual product le memory and half the hard drive
the dc adapter plugin is not a tight fit and easily becomes loose and let your battery run down while working i understand it a dell thing had to buy and install a new one also the hhd hard drive crashed after a year while under warranty so i sent it back to dell for a new one fearing it wa a refurbished hard drive i bought a 1tb crucial ssd and installed it happy with it now
