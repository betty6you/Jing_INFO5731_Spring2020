Review
the laptop arrived on time and exactly a advertised i plan on using it for writing research and coding
i usually wait awhile before writing review on computer equipment but in 10months no issue and performs a expected
ad offered a new machine machine delivered is used warranty expires on dec 24 two day from now
good computer for a good price
laptop is amazing it fast and display is good we can definitely recommend to student and for office purpose
i wish i didnt waste money buying the budget acerasus model first this is my 3rd laptop in a many month and finally an excellent one
i wa going to return this at first because i thought i just had to have a brand new computer and didnt notice it wa a used laptop i had contacted the seller and everything about returning it they said i could no problem but when i got it i decided to check it out i am glad i did i got everything i wanted in a very good laptop for le than i would have spent for a brand new one it wa in brand new condition too no scratch or anything my wireless mouse didnt work in one of the port but doe work in the others on the opposite site which actually worked out better the touchscreen come in handy too at time recorded sound quality is good the recording video quality could have been a bit better but all in all i am very pleased with this laptop
the bootup is quite fast exceeds my last laptop hand down i dont use the touch screen at all so i didnt rate it really seems like overkill on this machine i would have given it a 5 star rating except it doe not have a usb c connection i wa going to hook it up to a docking station but didnt realize that it did not have that capability i guess i should have looked closer other user have complained about fan noise i do not have any issue with the fan only occasionally can i even hear it i have been a dell user for many year now and i have also had several other brand of laptop but dell is my preferred laptop
speed is ok screen is lower end quality bad contrast washed out i received a used unit not new a listed laptop work correctly after some update were applied perhaps a like new should have been in the description
when i tried to start the computer the first time it said no bootable item i go to dellcomsupport and find out the warranty expired 26 jun 2019 i ordered the computer in january on 2020 avoid this product and seller at all cost total rip off
not very happy with the screen high density look the new window and office have been hard to implement i have tried to adjust the setting but still cannot get the system to perform a needed
absolutely love it
good day i live in argentina i bought the product from you in february a friend brought it to me in march from miami and it broke a month in april i bought it from argentina at first it worked well but one day the hard drive failed and the window blue screen went on it never worked again how can we solve this problem because i consider that they sold me a failed product i am looking forward to your response
it light enough and wa slightly overheating on first use but the speed is great and ssd fly right now i cant fault the pc save that i belong to that camp that doesnt understand the need of a touch screen laptop i think it a waste nonetheless dell delivered a expected
this computer ha an amazing processor it is so fast and yet had a reasonable price im very happy with it
i ordered new and recurved used one i will return it
i purchased this laptop with upgraded ram 32gb and ssd 1tb it arrived near may 15 2019 the fan died this morning june 26 2020 only one year and 6 week from when i purchased the laptop the warranty is for 3yr and 1yr when i ran diagnostics it said the warranty started in 2018 and ended december of 2019 dell wanted to charge me for support when i asked to escalate chat to a supervisor they said no one wa working until the weekday i have been buying dell laptop for 20 year for work and never ha anything broken within the first year in fact i usually buy the cheapest one and change them every 2 year this is the first time i purchased a more expensive one thinking it would last at least a long a the 500 laptop nor have i ever had a support person blow me off like this
the boot time is pretty long after 30 min of moderate usage i started getting not responding error load time for application wa surprisingly long the typing on the keyboard wa laggy just out of the box i would not recommend this laptop for any more than light surfing and streaming the seller is awesome though i would buy from them any time
i did not like it because it din not work right also when will i receive my refund it been one month
my son ha the same device snd i liked it but the silver keyboard wa hard for me to see so wanted a silver case with black keyboard the contrast of white letterson black would be easier for me to see picture showed that nothing in description about keyboard except it wa backlit opened box and no black keyboard very disappointed
excellent pc work perfectly is very fast it wa worth the money
best laptop i have ever had and i have had 4 others
ive used this laptop for a few week now and can say it met what i needed it for so far
i love it
the item came promptly from the beginning the touch screen didnt work but i could live with that but when i went to take a class and couldnt hear a message popped up that there wa no sound card now they wont issue a refund and are saying it amazon responsibility getting the royal run around
overall good laptop for casual use i am not a fan of the backlit keyboard because it can be difficult to see the key sometimes i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a fast easy to use solution for shopping reading and reasearch
this laptop have been giving my son significant issue especially with the battery mere week after purchasing the laptop it will not work unless it is plugged in my son ha his school assignment and is having nightmare trying to complete an assignment he tried to persist with it but working with a laptop that doe not give you a good half hour after powering up something is wrong some letter on the keyboard stick when you press them and do type a a parent and the one that purchase this laptop i know that i have disadvantage my son and feel very responsible for this inadequate purchase on my part
i bought this model at 800 realizing it isnt on the high or low end of the spectrum when it come to buying a laptop but ive already sent this unit in twice for repair and it look like im going to have to send it again im not saying anything negative about the customer service which is why im giving 2 star because theyve been nothing but kind and have assisted me greatly but to send in a unit three time for repair within three month and cost 800 save your money and look for a different unit
fast and perfect computer
it ha already had issue that require repair beyond the inhouse it guy
this worked a expected and is a really good value for a laptop that ha a 2nd hd
all good with the laptop ecxept for the ethernet speed the specification said gigabit ethernet port but it max up at 100mbps download i spoke to dell support tech and i tried everything to get it over 100mbps but no luck i wa able to get the wifi speed over 200mbps but still low based on my 600mbps internet service
nnnnnnnnnn n n me sorprendio la rapidez y la practicidad esta e mi primera laptop con pantalla tactil me llevo un tiempo acostumbrarme de dejar de usar el mouse muy liviana puedo llevarlo tanto al cafe al parque o a la cama la betería con excelente vida útil para mi a sido una buena compran n n n
love my laptop it sleek efficient light and easy to use
product sold a used but the announcement said a new when i received the product i tried to find out how long i would have to guarantee unfortunately i wa informed by the service code that the guarantee had already expired
this laptop is used by my wife and replaces her older 2016 dell inspiron 15 3000 3552 laptop she enjoys the speed feel of the keyboard and the touchscreen display havent heard of any complaint only praise
this review is being written by a non techie person good memory well lit screen easy use i use this laptop for email and publisher work well the laptop is heavier then you might like if you carry your laptop often it is fine for me a i rarely take it off my desk at home i thought the price wa very good for the capability it ha
best money i have ever spentlove the backlight keyboardworks great and very fasti would really recommend this product
after about 25 month of using this laptop i started to get the blue screen of death error message contacted the seller and got no response it turned out that the the thirdparty extra memory that wa added to the original dell laptop wa defective i ended up spending more money to fix this through dell because it wa not covered by manufacture warranty this issue seam to be a very common with this retailer so dont buy unless you are willing to spend extra money on a brand new laptop
great product
it great
i got this a a gift from my best friend she went all out loading it with ram and a sata drive i cannot believe how fast it is a soon a i hit the last digit for my password when signing in boom it load it s backlit which is a god send it o super slim and lightweight all of my laptop have had trouble waiting for cache in chrome no more nothing ever get hung up i never wait for a page to load the touch pad wa odd so i went in and reset the whole thing and i never have a problem with it anymore i went in to taskmanager and turned off thing running in the background and did the same in setting open setting click on privacy click on background apps under the choose which apps can run in the background section turn off the toggle switch for the apps you want to restrict so these made it faster also i use this thing sometmes 12 hour a day and it ha been a joy i am so happy the seller made this build possible
warning avoid all dell product in the event that you might need to call customer support i have an inspiron 15 gaming 7567 and wa out of warranty when i experienced a major slow down in performance and slow wifi through just the laptop 20 mbps download while other device were recieving 600 mbps hoping to speak with tech support i purchased a single incident support for advanced software support for 99 after submitting payment i wa never contacted by tech support instead it say it would take 2 day to process eventhough prior to paying for the service they said to stay by your phone for tech to contact you right away regarding your issue i eventually solved the problem by spending 7 hour refreshingrebooting window 10 since dell tech did not help i assumed i could easily get a refund for the single incident support for advanced software support this is where it got ugly i called support line and got bounced around from deptment to deptartment having to reexplain my refund request each time after 30 min i thought i finally reached the right department the representative said they needed to put me on a short hold i wa promptley hung up on after calling back it took over 2 hour for them to process a refund all the while repeating my first experience between department after 1 12 hour into the call i thought i wa seriously being punked exaserbating this horrible experience wa a definiite communication breakdown support agent that i spoke with are difficult to understand dell tech support is completely overseas and it is not possible to speak to someone were english language is their first language awful awful awful experience avoid buyer beware your device will need support at some time you were forewarned
the screen quality is very good especially for gaming and movie keypad and mouse ha a good feel it typing noise is a little noticeable even if to type softly the 156inch size is very good for multiwindow working which is good for work or class notetaking the only thing that doe make me regret buying this laptop is the noise that the fan make when it overheats if you are doing anything big on the laptop it will come to overheating quicker thus will trigger the epic fan noise this can be a distraction in a quite environment such a library or classroom a well battery life will go down quickly if you do big thing such a gaming or streaming a movie with a cable charger it all good it okaygoodish laptop
the only thing i didnt like there wa one screw that wa not screwed in completely
used for my daughter to go to college work great
overall this laptop is ok i dont love it the builtin wifi antenna is submediocre i had to buy an external netgear a6210 adapter it wa dirt slow watching video otherwise no it wasnt my router the other device were fine using the wifi in my house also the trackpad is squishy the trackpad just feel poorly made like an old car that is about to fall apart otherwise it performs fine
i ordered this laptop in december 2019 for my daughter 18th birthday after 1 week it stopped working to this date 02172020 i have been back and forth with the seller to send me their information to ship back the item and to get a full refund dont waste your money
bought mine from costco thankfully so it wa super easy to return the fan is louder than an airplane seriously it so loud it giving me a headache which i might overlook if i didnt spend all my time on this computer waiting for something to happen soooo sloooowwww i have 10year old computer for my kid that run program and load page faster than this piece of junk brand new pretty much giving up on dell at this point
the dc adapter plugin is not a tight fit and easily becomes loose and let your battery run down while working i understand it a dell thing had to buy and install a new one also the hhd hard drive crashed after a year while under warranty so i sent it back to dell for a new one fearing it wa a refurbished hard drive i bought a 1tb crucial ssd and installed it happy with it now
this is my second dell laptop the first one wa great and only replaced to get window 10 this one ha been a problem from the beginning always message popping up if i press too hard on the key then there are pop ups that prevent me from typing now after le than a year the key seem to stick and it slows me down trying to get a computer fixed because i use it for bill etc is difficult so i just put up with it but my next laptop probably wont be a dell
dell ha some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life my hard drive failed after le than a year of use and after going through 4 level of support they told me there is nothing they can do except to pay for a repairxa0dell hard drive should last more than a year and if they dont you should stand behind your product very disappointing and it will be the last dell i ever buy for our family which mean something a i will likely be purchasing 4 laptop in the next 5 year a my child get older
very disappointing to have so short battery life which go down withing 1h bad product
beautiful and fast
very satisfied with this purchase
