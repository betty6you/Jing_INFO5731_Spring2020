not sure at this time if the touch screen is worthy of the extra cost
overall this laptop is ok i dont love it the builtin wifi antenna is submediocre i had to buy an external netgear a6210 adapter it wa dirt slow watching video otherwise no it wasnt my router the other device were fine using the wifi in my house also the trackpad is squishy the trackpad just feel poorly made like an old car that is about to fall apart otherwise it performs fine
came in evening around 11pm so in thankful usps wa still working but had a few scratch on the outside a if it ha been used but im greatly in need of a good computer and so far it working terrific and fast the touch screen of course doesnt really have any use unless i am feeling lazy about using the mouse but this computer is great but please amazon or dell send a brand new computer without scratch on top of it because i would have put a 5 star if it came brand new buyer beware
so what do you give a sister who cook clean take out the trash and love facebook a new laptop i bought this laptop for the spec the laptop ha gobbs of memory and enough hard drive space for million of picture i hope she like it im pretty sure that she will love it
i bought this computer because i wa looking for a computer for my wife that had a ssd at least 16gb of ram and at least a i5 processor also my wife feel more comfortable working on window this one wa a good balance between price and spec it look a lot like a macbook pro but it feel a little more fragile than a mac she also liked that this one had a full keyboard including the number keypad the touchscreen in a thing like a laptop is something that i feel that is useless it doesnt respond a well a a modern cellphone doe we were looking for a laptop with ssd but this one also had an internal hdd of 1tb which is useful for storing all the data that are not critical to access that wa something nice that we found
so far after a few week of use we are loving this laptop i spent a lot of time researching to get a laptop within our budget that ran really well this one check off all the box speed memory sound and screen are all great very happy with our choice we use this for personal and business use
only thing i dont like is even with turning on keyboard light which ha to be continually pressed difficult to see character on key
i am a software developer and have been using some memory intensive program and needed an upgrade i have been extremely happy with this machine from the second it came out of the box boot speed is incredible with the ssd i timed my bootup from completely off is about 12 second i am running a data heavy node application heavy development server vscode spotify and about 10 tab on google chrome and this thing isnt even breaking a sweat with mentioned program im still using a little le than half the memory and barely utilizing the cpu i did a ton of research and this wa the absolute best bang for the buck i could find and would buy again in a heartbeat only flaw screen is okay i wasnt buying this machine for the screen but i have seen laptop in the price range with better display why is this thing touchscreen literally no need
i bought this laptop for personal home use mainly internet searching surfing and using microsoft office i do not have many hour on the machine yet i bought it configured with extra ram and a ssd for fast boot speedy and quiet operation overall the machine seems to boot quick and run fast my one negative is that this dell ha a very loud fan that cycle on and off with no optical drive i wonder what the chip set is doing to generate enough heat to make the fan run
i have had this laptop for about a month and a half and i love it it boot up in second multitasking is super fast simultaneously downloading several file while listening to itunes and working on spreadsheet didnt slow this machine one bit and it ha load of memory space although i generally dont use the touchscreen feature it is kind of cool the fingerprint reader work perfectly you will be hard pressed to find a comparable laptop at anywhere close to this price i also bought the laplink pcmover software from amazon which made it a fast and seamless transfer
i wish it would weight le and the surface for the mouse would feel smother under my finger everything else is fine thank you
great laptop very fast and quiet not sure where people say the fan is too load because we cant hear anything the only reason i gave it a 4 star is because i wa on the phone with dell for two hour trying to resolve the hard drive issue the 1 tb wa not showing up on the laptop after several transfer from dell the right person wa able to activate the 1 tb drive everything else wa in working order
so far this look to be the best laptop that i have ever owned very fast using m2 solid state drive for o and 1 tb hdd for storage the description say no optical drive but mine came with a dvdrw drive did i receive the wrong model the only negative is no c port but that is just a small negative
run really fast and you can turn the back lit keyboard on or off with f10 nice screen plenty of port and dvd drive shuts down quick this one i have is silver instead of just black low heat with the computer nice sized screen very comfortable
i wa looking to replace a 7 year old laptop that seen better daysi looked for month on and off i add this one to my list because it matched the dimension of the old laptop with some upgrade and minus other stuff i dont need anymore just like everyone else i wa pleased with a new laptop i had an issue with with tag not matching what the software wa showing i called dell to see what the issue wa the agent informed me that the laptop wa upgrade by an authorized vendor they forgot to update the tag to show it been upgraded the agent then proceeded to tell me the upgrade bumped the cost of the unit from 3 00 to 400 higher than the base unit i went on dell website to price it out and he wa right i got way more than what i paid for it i have no complaint with the unit aside from the battery life
this computer ha proven to be fast and just what i needed setup wa easy and it move at lightening speed
bought 2 of these for my grown up child they absolutely love this computer very happy
great little computer
literally the only thing i would say about this laptop is that i wish the touchscreen wa just a little more responsive dont get me wrong it still a great touchscreen i just wish it registered the touch just a little more accurately other than that the laptop is super fast and i havent had any issue i wa a little hesitant to by a dell because i thought gaming brand like asus might be better constructed but going forward i will definitely consider dell this ha been the best laptop ive owned so far
im very happy with the performance
my purchase of this laptop ha proven to be everything i had hoped for ive had no problem since it arrived and setup wa snap i had some good technical advice from my son in the selection and he came through
excellent item
product is used pacifically for personbusiness use only
it work great right out of the box adding microsoft office professional fast quiet and responds fast
so for so good still setting it up
it doe a advertised quick connectivity via wifi
dell product are top of the heep
the laptop arrived on time and exactly a advertised i plan on using it for writing research and coding
i usually wait awhile before writing review on computer equipment but in 10months no issue and performs a expected
good computer for a good price
laptop is amazing it fast and display is good we can definitely recommend to student and for office purpose
i wish i didnt waste money buying the budget acerasus model first this is my 3rd laptop in a many month and finally an excellent one
i wa going to return this at first because i thought i just had to have a brand new computer and didnt notice it wa a used laptop i had contacted the seller and everything about returning it they said i could no problem but when i got it i decided to check it out i am glad i did i got everything i wanted in a very good laptop for le than i would have spent for a brand new one it wa in brand new condition too no scratch or anything my wireless mouse didnt work in one of the port but doe work in the others on the opposite site which actually worked out better the touchscreen come in handy too at time recorded sound quality is good the recording video quality could have been a bit better but all in all i am very pleased with this laptop
the bootup is quite fast exceeds my last laptop hand down i dont use the touch screen at all so i didnt rate it really seems like overkill on this machine i would have given it a 5 star rating except it doe not have a usb c connection i wa going to hook it up to a docking station but didnt realize that it did not have that capability i guess i should have looked closer other user have complained about fan noise i do not have any issue with the fan only occasionally can i even hear it i have been a dell user for many year now and i have also had several other brand of laptop but dell is my preferred laptop
absolutely love it
it light enough and wa slightly overheating on first use but the speed is great and ssd fly right now i cant fault the pc save that i belong to that camp that doesnt understand the need of a touch screen laptop i think it a waste nonetheless dell delivered a expected
this computer ha an amazing processor it is so fast and yet had a reasonable price im very happy with it
my son ha the same device snd i liked it but the silver keyboard wa hard for me to see so wanted a silver case with black keyboard the contrast of white letterson black would be easier for me to see picture showed that nothing in description about keyboard except it wa backlit opened box and no black keyboard very disappointed
excellent pc work perfectly is very fast it wa worth the money
best laptop i have ever had and i have had 4 others
ive used this laptop for a few week now and can say it met what i needed it for so far
i love it
overall good laptop for casual use i am not a fan of the backlit keyboard because it can be difficult to see the key sometimes i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a fast easy to use solution for shopping reading and reasearch
fast and perfect computer
this worked a expected and is a really good value for a laptop that ha a 2nd hd
all good with the laptop ecxept for the ethernet speed the specification said gigabit ethernet port but it max up at 100mbps download i spoke to dell support tech and i tried everything to get it over 100mbps but no luck i wa able to get the wifi speed over 200mbps but still low based on my 600mbps internet service
love my laptop it sleek efficient light and easy to use
this laptop is used by my wife and replaces her older 2016 dell inspiron 15 3000 3552 laptop she enjoys the speed feel of the keyboard and the touchscreen display havent heard of any complaint only praise
this review is being written by a non techie person good memory well lit screen easy use i use this laptop for email and publisher work well the laptop is heavier then you might like if you carry your laptop often it is fine for me a i rarely take it off my desk at home i thought the price wa very good for the capability it ha
best money i have ever spentlove the backlight keyboardworks great and very fasti would really recommend this product
great product
it great
i got this a a gift from my best friend she went all out loading it with ram and a sata drive i cannot believe how fast it is a soon a i hit the last digit for my password when signing in boom it load it s backlit which is a god send it o super slim and lightweight all of my laptop have had trouble waiting for cache in chrome no more nothing ever get hung up i never wait for a page to load the touch pad wa odd so i went in and reset the whole thing and i never have a problem with it anymore i went in to taskmanager and turned off thing running in the background and did the same in setting open setting click on privacy click on background apps under the choose which apps can run in the background section turn off the toggle switch for the apps you want to restrict so these made it faster also i use this thing sometmes 12 hour a day and it ha been a joy i am so happy the seller made this build possible
the screen quality is very good especially for gaming and movie keypad and mouse ha a good feel it typing noise is a little noticeable even if to type softly the 156inch size is very good for multiwindow working which is good for work or class notetaking the only thing that doe make me regret buying this laptop is the noise that the fan make when it overheats if you are doing anything big on the laptop it will come to overheating quicker thus will trigger the epic fan noise this can be a distraction in a quite environment such a library or classroom a well battery life will go down quickly if you do big thing such a gaming or streaming a movie with a cable charger it all good it okaygoodish laptop
the only thing i didnt like there wa one screw that wa not screwed in completely
used for my daughter to go to college work great
beautiful and fast
